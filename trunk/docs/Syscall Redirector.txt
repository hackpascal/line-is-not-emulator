Linux Syscall Redirector -- for Windows NT/Windows 2000

The line\src\int80\ subdirectory contains a Windows NT/2000 device driver that 
redirects Linux system calls back to the originating process.  This results in 
a significant performance increase and enables a Windows debugger to be attached
to a running Linux application. 


WARNING!    This driver is experimental.  It works on my system, but
WARNING!    it may not on yours.  Be prepared for your system to crash.


The line\src\int80\i386\ sub-directory contains a Windows 2000 version of the
driver, int80.sys.  I don't believe this binary will work on Windows NT.  
Unfortunately, I don't have a Windows NT system to test the driver with.
 

Using the driver
----------------

The two batch files, install.bat and remove.bat (in line\src\int80), 
will load/unload the driver.  

Once the driver is loaded, run LINE normally.  It should detect the driver 
and alter its behavior accordingly.

There is a simple test program in the line\src\int80\test\ subdirectory that 
can be used to verify that the driver is working.  


Building the driver
-------------------

You will need Microsoft Visual C++ and the Microsoft DDK to build int80.sys.

The DDK is downloadable from http://www.microsoft.com/ddk/

1.  Install the DDK

2.  If you are using Windows NT, open int80.c and follow the comment
    at the top of the file.  Windows 2000 users can ignore this step.

3.  From the "Free Build Environment", run 'build' from the int80 directory.  

4.  If all goes well, int80.sys will be located in the i386/ sub-directory 



Thanks to Michael Stout <mstout@users.sourceforge.net> for providing
the working example that made this driver possible!
