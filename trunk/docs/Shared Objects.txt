As of version 0.3, the LINE loader supports dynamically linked executables.  
This means that running an application under LINE is just a matter of copying it
off your Linux box/partition.  However before a dynamic executable will
load, you will also need to get the shared objects it requires.

The general methodology is to run 'ldd appname' on your Linux system, see
what it requires then copy all of those into the Cygwin /lib directory or 
somewhere else where the loader will be able to find them.
