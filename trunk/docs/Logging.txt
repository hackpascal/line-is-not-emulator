LINELog

LINE uses a separate and independent logging program called LINELog.  LINELog 
has an extensible framework which allows you to add/remove log handlers
(log to console, log to file, log to database, etc) without recompiling LINELog 
itself.

Currently there is only one logging handler for LINELog, logcon.dll.

Before LINELog will use logcon.dll, it needs to be registered.  Do this by  
running the command "logconf.exe -r logcon.dll" from the main LINE directory.


logconf.exe has a number of other options.  Run "logconf --help" 

The most important option is '-c', it lets you configure a individual log 
handler.  

Run "logconf.exe -c logcon.dll" to view the configuration options 
for the logcon.dll handler.

Examples:
To save the all future log output to a file, run:
	
	logcon.exe -c logcon.dll -f logfile.txt


Change the minimum logging level run:
	logcon.exe -c logcon.dll -l NUMBER

  where NUMBER is either 0,1,2,4 or 8  
  (these magic numbers are defined in common/log.h)
      ---
      #define LOG_ERROR        8
      #define LOG_WARN         4
      #define LOG_NORMAL       2
      #define LOG_VERBOSE      1
      #define LOG_DEBUG        0
      ---

  The default log level is LOG_VERBOSE


NOTE: LINELog does not exit when LINE exits, it sticks around in the Windows
system tray.  You can kill it by either right clicking on the system tray
icon or by running "logconf -k"
