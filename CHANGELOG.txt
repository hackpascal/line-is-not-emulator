0.6(Sep 01, 2011)
  - Fix error in win7
  - change '/' path to current path
  - lot of another bugs

0.5 (May 29, 2001)
  - Fixed problem with running LINE from a directory with a space in it
  - The 'internal syscalls' are not hardcoded anymore, they are now all #defined
    in src/common/internal_syscalls.h
  - Major changes to the Makefiles, all the dependency problems should
    be fixed now
  - fixed the hard coding of ProcesInfo.fixedMem[] constants 
    (now they are all defined in src/common/memflags.h)
  - int80.sys -- a NT/2000 linux syscall redirector device driver


0.4 (March 21, 2001)
  - fixed a bug findLinexec() which caused a "Unable to run Linexec" error 
  - removed the excess code in Line.c that dealt with the core dumping as it
    was unnecessary
  - preliminary support for native shared objects (native to Windows that is)
  - added real command line argument handling using getopt()
  - added --chroot option
  - Linexec.exe checks to ensure that it is running under LINE debugger before
    transfering control to the Linux application
  - readlink() actually works now
  - partially implemented mremap()
  - On NT/2000, MAP_ANONYMOUS will not actually commit the memory until it is
    first used by the process.
  - fixed getuid() to return uid values other than zero.
  - implemented statfs() and fstatfs()
  - preliminary work on a real logging system
  - implemented nanosleep()
  - stat()/lstat()/fstat() fixed so that they return a resonable value in 
    st_size for directories (Cygwin returns zero which causes Pico to crash)
  - fixed coredump to include EBP
  - translates the open() flags correctly to their Cygwin equivalents
  - started on some documentation (the docs/ subdirectory)
  - sysctl returns ENOTDIR instead of ENOSYS


0.3 (March 4, 2001)
  - Created the CHANGELOG.txt file 
  - Added ELF interpreter support
  - Major overhaul of the mmap() and friends.  MAP_FIXED is no longer 
    implemented by the mmapper.dll kludge.  However there is still much work 
    to do in this area.
  - Major overhaul of execve().  LINE now uses a binfmt system similiar to 
    Linux for loading different types of executables.  LINE can currently 
    run Linux ELF executables, Windows executables and shell scripts.  
  - Minor overhaul to the Makefile system so dependencies are handled better
  - Enabled -Wall and cleaned up most of the resulting warnings
  - More tolerant about the location of Linexe.exe, it just needs to be in the
    same directory as Line.exe (0.2 required that Linexec be in the 
    current directory)
  - Removed the Visual C++ project files. Now that LINE is 100% gcc compiled 
    there is no need to keep the Visual C++ project files.
  - Cleaned up the assembly in asm.h, put Linexec's syscall dispatcher
    in its own file.
  - Moved Line.exe's process table stuff into a separate file (process_table.c)
  - Wrote a quick little DLL rebasing utility.  Can't use the Microsoft 
    rebase.exe from the Win32 SDK because it doesn't seem to be 
    redistributable.  I wrote it for mmapper.dll, unfortuantly mmapper.dll
    is not longer used!  But I just don't have the heart to delete it, maybe
    somebody will find it useful.
  - Moved the base address of Linexec.exe to 0x65000000
  - If a Linux process segfaults LINE will only kill that process instead
    of terminating everything and exiting
  - Added primative core dumping support
  - Fixed open() so that it works for directories on Windows 98


0.2 (February 22, 2001)
  - Compiles with gcc except for mmapper.dll
  - Uses the Cygwin API to emulate a fair number of the Linux syscalls
  - Much faster and more stable than 0.1


0.1 (October 19, 2000)
  - initial release
