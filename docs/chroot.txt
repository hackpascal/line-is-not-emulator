All about the --chroot flag

LINE supports a --chroot flag which allows you to restrict the Linux 
applications to a subdirectory of your filesystem.



Example:

Create a bin/ and lib/ subdirectory in the LINE directory. Then copy all 
your Linux applications into bin/ and put any shared objects they require 
in lib/. Then from the LINE directory, run:

	./line --chroot . /bin/app_name 

        (omit the leading ./ from the command line if you are using the 
         Windows prompt instead of the Cygwin bash shell) 

where app_name is one of the applications you copied into the 
bin/ subdirectory. 



Example:

If you have a Linux box running Samba, export the entire Linux filesystem 
over Samba.  Then mount it on your Windows box (say on drive R:).  Then you can just do something like:
	
	Line.exe --chroot r: /bin/bash

Note that there are a couple problems that I've encountered with using Samba in 
this way.  

First, disk I/O is really slow.  bash takes about twice as long to load over 
Samba than it does when it's on the local Windows filesystem.  

Second, I've noticed some weird behaviour where certain programs will crash 
when loaded over Samba.  However they run fine when they are loaded from the 
local Windows filesystem.  If something crashes over Samba, try it locally 
first before blaming LINE :)
